# Mind map visualization for NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500
Visualization for New York State Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies

# Purpose
This project provides a mind map for a cybersecurity requirements document.

# Levels
This project uses seven levels. The first level is shown here:
![Mindmap L1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScaleSec/nysdfs_23_nycrr_500/master/images/NYSDFS 23 NYCRR 500 L1.png "Mindmap L1")

# Usage
You can use this Mind Map to graphically navigate the requirements. For example, since 500.22 describes grace periods for due dates, perhaps we want to see all of the requirements due one year after the effective date (March 1, 2018).
![Requirements Due 2018-03-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScaleSec/nysdfs_23_nycrr_500/master/images/NYSDFS 23 NYCRR 500 Due 2018-03-01.png "Requirements Due 2018-03-01")

Or, since the document contains a lot of supporting information like definitions and exemptions, perhaps you just want to view all of the sections/subsections that are actionable. For this, we can filter by items that have a due date.

From here, you could manage each task by assigning level of effort, priorities, and tracking progress.
